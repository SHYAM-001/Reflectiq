# ReflectiQ - Strategic Laser Puzzle Game

An innovative laser reflection puzzle game built for Reddit using the Devvit platform. ReflectiQ challenges players to trace invisible laser beams through hidden grids filled with mirrors, glass, water, and other materials using strategic hint management and physics-based deduction.

## What is ReflectiQ?

ReflectiQ is a revolutionary grid-based puzzle game that combines physics simulation with strategic information management. Players must predict where a laser beam will exit after bouncing through a completely hidden grid containing various reflective and refractive materials. The game's core innovation is its **progressive revelation system** - you start with a blank grid and must strategically use exactly 4 hints to reveal quarter-sections, balancing information gathering with solving speed.

### The Ultimate Deduction Challenge

Unlike traditional puzzle games, ReflectiQ presents players with a **completely hidden grid** at the start. You can only see:

- The laser entry point (pulsing red dot)
- Grid coordinates (A1, B2, C3, etc.)
- A timer counting your solving time

Your mission: Determine where the laser exits using strategic hint usage and physics-based reasoning.

### Core Gameplay Mechanics

**🔬 Advanced Physics Simulation**: ReflectiQ features authentic laser behavior with 5 distinct material types, each affecting the beam differently:

- **🪞 Mirrors**: Reflect laser at precise angles (45°, 90°, 135°, 120°, 60°) with visual line indicators showing exact orientation
- **💧 Water**: Refracts the beam through realistic physics, subtly changing direction with distinctive blue coloring
- **🔍 Glass**: Allows partial transmission while creating complex reflection patterns with transparency effects
- **🔩 Metal**: Acts as an impenetrable barrier that completely blocks and stops the laser beam
- **⚫ Absorber**: Specialized material that terminates the laser entirely (meaning no exit point exists for that puzzle)

**🧠 Revolutionary 4-Hint Strategic System**: The game's signature innovation is its progressive revelation mechanic:

- **Complete Information Blackout**: Start with a totally hidden grid - only the laser entry point and coordinates are visible
- **Strategic Quadrant Reveals**: Use exactly 4 hints to reveal quarter-sections in sequence: top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right
- **Resource Management Challenge**: Each hint is precious - plan which sections to reveal based on laser entry point and likely path
- **Progressive Discovery**: Watch materials appear as you reveal quadrants, showing mirrors, glass, water, metal, and absorbers in their exact positions
- **Full Laser Visualization**: After using all 4 hints, witness the complete animated laser path with glowing red dashed beam trace
- **Time vs. Information Balance**: Faster solving earns higher scores, but insufficient information leads to wrong answers

- **Progressive Discovery**: Each hint permanently reveals a quarter-section with all materials in that area
- **Time Pressure**: Timer runs continuously, creating tension between information gathering and solving speed
- **Risk Assessment**: Balance thorough investigation against competitive completion time for optimal scoring

### Step 3: Strategic Hint Usage

**This is where ReflectiQ becomes a strategy game implemented through sophisticated React state management!**

1. **Plan Your Reveals**: Analyze the laser entry point and think strategically about which quadrant to reveal first

   - Consider the entry direction and likely laser path based on `puzzleData.entry` coordinate
   - Think about which quarter sections are most likely to contain the laser route using grid analysis

2. **Execute Hint Usage**: Click the HintButton component to reveal quadrants via `handleUseHint()` function

   - Button shows remaining hints (4/4 → 3/4 → 2/4 → 1/4 → 0/4) managed by `hintsRemaining={4 - hintsUsed}` prop
   - Each click reveals one quarter of the grid permanently by updating `revealedQuadrants` state array
   - Button becomes disabled when all hints are used (`disabled={hintsRemaining === 0}`)

3. **Visual Feedback System** (implemented through multiple React components):

   - **Toast Notifications**: "Hint X revealed! Quarter section illuminated." appears for 2 seconds using `toast.success()` from Sonner
   - **Pulse Animations**: Newly revealed cells pulse with animation effects using `animate-pulse` CSS class applied when `isRevealed={revealed}` is true
   - **Hover Tooltips**: Mouse over revealed cells to see material type information in overlay with `bg-card/90 backdrop-blur-sm` styling
   - **Material Visualization**: Each material type has distinct colors and visual indicators using `getMaterialColor()` function and CSS custom properties

4. **Progressive Strategy Phases** (controlled by game state):

   - **Hints 1-3**: Strategically reveal quadrants to trace the laser path step by step using the quadrant calculation logic
   - **Hint 4 (Final)**: After using all hints (`showLaser={hintsUsed === 4}`), an animated red laser beam appears as SVG overlay showing the complete path with glowing dashed lines and drop shadow effects
   - **Path Analysis**: Study the full laser visualization rendered by the SVG line element to confirm your exit point prediction

5. **Information Management** (strategic gameplay mechanics):
   - Study each revealed quadrant thoroughly before using the next hint to maximize information value
   - Look for material patterns and potential laser bounce sequences using the `getMaterialAtPosition()` function
   - Consider how materials in different quadrants might interact based on laser physics simulation

### Step 4: Trace the Laser Path

1. **Start at Entry Point**: Begin tracing from the red pulsing laser entry point (identified by `isEntry` prop and marked with ring indicator)

   - Note the entry coordinate from `puzzleData.entry` (e.g., A1, B3, etc.) generated by `getCellPosition()` function
   - Determine the initial laser direction based on entry position and grid boundaries

2. **Follow Physics-Based Interactions**: Mentally calculate how the beam interacts with revealed materials using the Material type system

   - **Mirrors**: Pay attention to the visual line indicators created by `getMaterialIcon()` function showing reflection angles
     - 45° mirrors create diagonal reflections using CSS `transform: rotate(45deg)`
     - 90° mirrors create perpendicular bounces using CSS `transform: rotate(90deg)`
     - 135°, 120°, and 60° create complex multi-bounce patterns with respective rotation transforms
   - **Water**: Note refraction effects that subtly change beam direction (material type 'water')
   - **Glass**: Consider partial transmission with some reflection (material type 'glass')
   - **Metal**: Identify complete beam blocking where laser stops (material type 'metal')
   - **Absorbers**: Recognize beam termination where no exit point exists (material type 'absorber')

3. **Multi-Bounce Calculations** (physics simulation logic):

   - Track the laser through multiple material interactions using the materials array from `puzzleData.materials`
   - Consider how the beam bounces between mirrors in sequence based on their angle properties
   - Account for direction changes through water refraction and glass transmission

4. **Path Verification** (visual confirmation system):

   - If you've used all 4 hints, observe the animated red laser beam visualization rendered by SVG overlay
   - The glowing dashed line (`stroke-dasharray="5,5"`) shows the exact path with drop shadow effects (`drop-shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(255,45,85,0.8)]`)
   - Verify your mental calculations against the visual representation provided by the SVG line element

5. **Determine Exit Point** (coordinate calculation):
   - Follow the laser path to where it exits the grid boundary using coordinate system
   - Note the exit coordinate using the grid labeling system (A1, B2, etc.) that matches `puzzleData.exit`
   - Ensure the laser actually reaches an exit (not blocked by metal/absorber materials)

### Step 5: Submit Your Answer

1. **Identify Exit Coordinate**: Determine where the laser exits using the coordinate system implemented by `getCellPosition()` function

   - **Grid System**: Letters = rows (A, B, C...), Numbers = columns (1, 2, 3...) generated by `String.fromCharCode(65 + row)` and `col + 1`
   - **Examples**: A1 (top-left), H8 (bottom-right for 8x8 grid), J10 (bottom-right for 10x10 grid)
   - **Coordinate Location**: Check the small coordinate labels in the corner of each GridCell component (position labels rendered in each cell)

2. **Submit Your Solution**: Click the "Submit Exit Cell" Button component (featuring Send icon from Lucide React)

   - Button is prominently displayed at the bottom of the PuzzleScreen interface with gradient primary styling
   - Features `bg-gradient-primary` with `shadow-glow-primary` and `hover:scale-105` animations via Tailwind CSS
   - Button is disabled when timer is not running (`disabled={!isTimerRunning}`) to prevent submissions after time stops

3. **Instant Feedback & Results** (handled by `handleSubmit()` function):

   - **Timer Stops**: Automatic timer halt (`setIsTimerRunning(false)`) when submission is processed
   - **Toast Notification**: "Answer submitted! Time stopped." appears for 3 seconds using `toast.success()` from Sonner
   - **Time Display**: Your completion time shown in MM:SS format in the toast description using `Math.floor((finalTime || 0) / 60)` calculation
   - **Button State**: Submit button becomes disabled to prevent multiple submissions
   - **Future Integration**: In production, this would open Reddit comment box for answer posting (currently shows info toast after 1 second delay)

4. **Scoring Factors** (tracked by React state):
   - **Completion Time**: Faster solutions earn higher scores (tracked via `finalTime` state updated by Timer component)
   - **Hints Used**: Fewer hints used results in better scoring (tracked via `hintsUsed` state counter)
   - **Difficulty Level**: Hard puzzles (10x10) earn more points than easy (6x6) or medium (8x8) based on `puzzleData.gridSize`
   - **Leaderboard Integration**: Your performance is tracked for global rankings displayed in Leaderboard component

### Step 6: Master Advanced Strategy

**Key to Success**: This isn't just about physics - it's about information management and strategic thinking!

**Strategic Hint Management**:

- **Don't Rush**: Avoid using all hints immediately - analyze each reveal thoroughly before proceeding
- **Quadrant Priority**: Reveal sections where you expect the laser path to travel first based on entry point
- **Information Efficiency**: Each hint is precious - make sure you extract maximum value from each reveal
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn common mirror arrangements and their typical reflection patterns

**Advanced Techniques**:

- **Entry Point Analysis**: Always start your strategy from the laser entry point and work outward
- **Path Prediction**: Try to mentally trace possible laser routes before revealing quadrants
- **Material Interaction Mastery**: Understand how different materials affect laser behavior:
  - Mirrors create predictable angle-based reflections
  - Water causes subtle directional changes through refraction
  - Glass allows partial transmission with some reflection
  - Metal and absorbers terminate the laser path entirely

**Competitive Optimization**:

- **Speed vs. Information Balance**: Weigh quick solving against gathering sufficient information
- **Risk Assessment**: Sometimes solving with fewer hints yields better scores despite uncertainty
- **Path Verification**: Double-check laser path calculations, especially complex multi-bounce sequences
- **Time Management**: Monitor the timer while making strategic decisions about hint usage

**Scoring Maximization**:

- **Minimize Hints**: Try to solve with 2-3 hints instead of all 4 for better scores
- **Optimize Speed**: Faster completion times significantly impact final scoring
- **Difficulty Selection**: Challenge yourself with harder puzzles for higher point multipliers
