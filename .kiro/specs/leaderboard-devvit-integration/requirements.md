# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing ReflectIQ puzzle game by integrating the leaderboard system with Devvit's custom post functionality and moderator menu actions. The system will leverage the existing InteractiveLeaderboard component and backend LeaderboardService to create Reddit posts that display real-time leaderboard data with proper difficulty level indicators.

## Glossary

- **Custom_Post**: A Devvit-specific post type that renders interactive content within Reddit
- **Moderator_Menu**: Reddit's moderator interface accessible through the three-dot menu on posts/subreddits
- **LeaderboardService**: Existing backend service that manages puzzle completion rankings and statistics
- **Leaderboard_Component**: Existing React component (Leaderboard.tsx) that displays leaderboard data with animations and styling
- **Difficulty_Badge**: Color-coded visual indicator showing puzzle difficulty (easy=green, medium=yellow, hard=red)
- **Post_Data**: Devvit mechanism for passing structured data from server to client components
- **Splash_Screen**: Initial display screen shown when users open a puzzle post
